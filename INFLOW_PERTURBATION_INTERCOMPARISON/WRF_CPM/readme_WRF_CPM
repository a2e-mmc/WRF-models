The subfolders within this directory (WRF_CPM) contain files to execute WRF
simulations using the cell perturbation method (CPM) in idealized, one-way
nested, two-domain setups, with the CPM used in the nested domain. Case
studies representing three stability classes, STABLE, NEUTRAL, and UNSTABLE,
are provided. Files to execute the single-domain LES with periodic lateral
boundary conditions used both to provide forcing for the two-domain setups,
and to evalute the results of the nested LES domain, are provided as well.

The two-domain simulations are set up to produce LES solutions on the
nested domains that can be compared directly with the corresponding periodic
LES solutions. This is achieved by using time- and domain-averaged vertical
profiles from the periodic LES solutions, after approaching nearly steady mean
profiles, turbulence statistics, and boundary-layer structure over time, as the
input_sounding files that determine the initial condition for the outer domain
of the two-domain setup. An averaging period of four hours is chosen for
preparation of the input, which removes all turbulent fluctuations from the
periodic LES profiles, hence approximating idealized mesoscale forcing.

The outer domain initialized with these profiles is then solved as a pure
advection solution, with no explicit diffusion or other forcing, so that the
inflow to the nested LES domain remains constant over time. Since this
time-invariant forcing (mean ABL depth, shear, veer, and temperature) is
identically the time-average of the corresponding periodic LES domain, the
nested LES domain solution should recover comparable turbulence statistics
to the periodic solution as the flow develops within the nested LES. This
setup enables a straightforward quantitative evaluation of the efficacies of
various inflow perturbation approaches to accelerate turbulence formation
and equilibration processes for LES domains forced with mesoscale or
time-averaged forcing data that does not explicitly contain resolved-scale
turbulence information.

For each of the three stability case studies, the periodic LES used both
to force and to evaluate the nested LES within the two-domain setup were
executed with the following forcing conditions:
   Geostrophic wind speed of 10 m/s,
   Roughness length = 0.1 m,
   Spinup time of approximately 48 hours under neutral forcing
   Continuation of simulations of stable and unstable conditions using
   sensible heat fluxes of -10, and 100 W/m^2, respectively, for sufficient
   time to achieve nearly steady conditions over time, as described below.

The three stability case studies use different grid spacings in the horizontal
(dx) and vertical (dz) direction, as well as different domain depths (Lz), and
damping layer depths (Dz), as shown in the table below.

               dx      dz      Lz      Dz
Stable         6        2    1600     400
Neutral        12       4    2400     800
Unstable       24       8    3200     800

All setups use the same number of horizontal grid points in their periodic
and nested-domain setups, with periodic domains using 481X481 grid points
in the x- and y-directions, and the two-domain setups using 481X481
and 481X961 grid points in the x- and y-directions for the outer and
nested domains, respectively.

While the case studies all use the same geostrophic wind speed, the angle 
varies slightly for each stability class to ensure approximately westerly
flow direction between the surface and 200 m. This alignment of the flow
with the computational grid enables a reduction in computational expense
within the nested LES by enabling use of a rectangular domain elongated in
the mean flow direction, in which the turbulence equilibration is assessed.

Other details of the computational domains can be obtained from the
namelist.input files in the subdirectories.

The initial conditions for the two-domain setups are obtained from the last
four hours of the periodic LES. This time window of data are also used for
evaluation of the nested LES in the two-domain setup.


NEUTRAL CASE

For the neutral case study, the periodic LES domain was run for 48 hours with
a surface heat flux value of 0, specified using namelist parameters
spec_hfx = 0, and spec_ideal = 1, the latter enabling a user-specified value
of spec_hfx to be applied at each model surface grid point. The geostrophic
wind direction is 286.0 degrees clockwise from North (Northwesterly flow),
yielding nearly westerly flow for the last 4 hours of the simulation.

Spinup time = 44 hours
0001/01/01/00:00 to 0001/01/02/20:00

Production time = 4 hours
0001/01/02/20:00 to 0001/01/03/00:00


STABLE CASE

For the stable case study, a neutral LES was run for 48 hours, with
spec_hfx = 0.0, after which an additional 35 hours were simulated using
spec_hfx = -10 (W/m^2). The geostrophic wind direction is 296.0 degrees
clockwise from North (Northwesterly flow), yielding nearly westerly flow
for the last 4 hours of the simulation.

Spinup time = 48 hours, neutral conditions, spec_hfx = 0
0001/01/01/00:00 to 0001/01/03/00:00

Spinup time = 31 hours, stable conditions, spec_hfx = -10
0001/01/03/00:00 to 0001/01/04/07:00

Production time = 4 hours, stable conditions, spec_hfx = -10
0001/01/07/07:00 to 0001/01/04/11:00


UNSTABLE CASE

For the unstable case study, a neutral LES was run for 48 hours with
spec_hfx = 0.0, after which an additional 33 hours were simulated using
spec_hfx = 100 (W/m^2).  The geostrophic wind direction is 281.0 degrees
clockwise from North (Northwesterly flow), yielding nearly westerly flow
for the last 4 hours of the simulation.

Spinup time = 48 hours, neutral conditions, spec_hfx = 0
0001/01/01/00:00 to 0001/01/03/00:00

Spinup time = 39 hours, unstable conditions, spec_hfx = 100
0001/01/03/00:00 to 0001/01/04/15:00

Production time = 4 hours, unstable conditions, spec_hfx = 100
0001/01/04/15:00 to 0001/01/04/19:00

For each of the case studies, the initial condition (input_sounding) for
the two-domain setup was computed from horizontal-average values of the
periodic simuations output, obtained at 10-minute frequency, for the last 4
hours. 

Each of the corresponding two-domain setups were then run for 5 hours using
the corresponding input_sounding file, with the first hour used to spin up
the nest, and the last four hours used for analysis.

Analysis data for all simulations include full 3D fields at 10-minute
frequency, and horizontal planes at ten heights (specified in the namelist
file) at 30-second frequency. 

Additional README files containing step-by-step instructions to complete all
of the above described simulations are contained in the subdirectories for
each stability case study below this directory.

To follow our workflow, make the following three directories
STABLE
UNSTABLE
NEUTRAL
and follow instructions from the readme files contained within those
directories provided here.

While the particulars of the geostrophic wind direction and durations of the
simulations used in this study are unique to the WRF model in the chosen
configuration, the same procedure can be followed using other codes,
which may predict slightly different solutions, due to different physics
and/or numerics. For example, SOWFA could be used to run both the periodic
LES to obtain both forcing and evaluation data, as well as another simulation
using lateral boundary conditions specified from the time-averaged periodic
LES output, similar to what was done with the WRF model. In this case,
however, the actual LES fields being compared would both be obtained
from the SOWFA solver, yieldig a consistent data set to examine the
efficacies of inflow perturbation entirely within that or any other code base.
